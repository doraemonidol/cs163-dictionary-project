																										n excellent strategist, Le Dai Hanh (941-1005) was the king founding Nha Tien Le (Pre-Le Dynasty) (980-1009). His native land was in Tho Xuan (Thanh Hoa). Born in a poor family, Le Hoan (future Le Dai Hanh) was an orphan from his early childhood but very studious. He was appointed as Commander-in-chief by Dinh Tien Hoang. In 979, after Dinh Tien Hoang had been assassinated, Le Hoan became the regent because Dinh Tien Hoang 's successor remained too young. In 980, the Tong Chinese dynasty prepared to annex our country. In 981, the queen mother Duong Van Nga and the armed forces unanimously enthroned Le Hoang as Le Dai Hanh. In 981, Le Dai Hanh trounced the Tong invaders on Bach Dang River and at Chi Lang Pass. After Le Dai Ha`nh's death in 1005, his son Le Long Dinh killed his elder brother to usurp the throne. Indulging in debauchery, this cruel king Le Long Dinh always stretched out at the royal conferences, therefore he was also called Le Ngoa. Trieu (Ngoa. Trieu means ""To stretch out at the royal conferences""). After his death, Ly Cong Uan replaced him in 1009 and founded Nha Hau Ly (Post-Ly Dynasty)"

Ca Tru appeared officially under Nha Hau Ly (11th century). First, it served royal and religious rituals and was called Hat Khuon. Later, it was used in banquets, weddings, friendly meetings... and called Hat Hang Hoa Ca Tru had bamboo castanets as principal+instrument. By beating time on tomtoms, spectators accompanied and praised the singer. Ca Tru was also called Hat Nha Tro (singing or dancing while pulling funny tricks), Hat Thuong (Singing to be rewarded by king or mandarins), Hat Cua Quyen (singing in royal palaces), Hat Cua Dinh (singing for religious rituals), Hat a dao (name of a famous songstress in the Ly times)....

																								o Bang is a mountainous province in North-Vietnam. Its provincial capital is under the same name. It shares a border of 314km with China to the north and the east, and is inhabited by many ethnic groups. Some 60km from the provincial capital is Pac Bo, a small hamlet in Truong Ha commune, Ha Quang district, close to the Vietnamese-Chinese border. In the local dialect, Pac Bo means watershed, where springs of clear water run. From Thai Nguyen City, provincial capital of Bac Thai province, you drive along Highway 3 to the towns of Bac Can and Phu Thong. After another 16km, you will arrive at Ba Be Lake which is about 225km from Ha Noi. The lake actually consists of three lakes called Pe Lam, Pe Lu and Pe Leng, so it is called Ba Be (Three Seas). Ba Be Lake is surrounded by limestone mountains and thick forests, home to many species of rare birds and animals"

The dish should be enjoyed as soon as it reaches the table and the fried pastry topped with red shrimps eaten together with the dishes of spicy vegetables and mixed sweet and sour sauce. To remind you of the local shrimp business, waiters could tell you that the shrimps you have for your meal had just been netted from nearby Ho Tay"

																														DISCOVERING Tay Bac (North-West). There was a time, not so long ago, when Tay Bac or the north-west region of Vietnam, was so remote an area that people were scared to go there. In retrospect, the remoteness seems to have been a blessing in disguise. The region's wilderness, its mountains and culture that are unique to it have been drawing an increasing number of domestic and foreign tourists. Tourist facilities in the region are still insufficient, but that cannot stop the back-packers from going there and taking in the splendid scenic vistas on offer. The ethnic minorities and their way of life as yet untouched by modern civilisation are another alluring factor They come here in organised tours, informal groups, or even individually on motorbikes. The sharp bends and curves in the mountainous area are thrilling to negotiate and offer marvellous views of the Thai and Tay tribal villages from the heights, and of the H'Mong houses rising out of the rocks and clouds atop the mountains. Visitors can also meet ethnic people in colourful attire on their way to the market or the fields. The population here lives on rice and handloom cloth which are woven with colourful ethnic motifs. The cloth is sold in every houseIn Tay Bac, weekly markets held every Sunday has presented the same scenes for decades  a couple going to the market with the husband on a horse and the wife walking behind; youngsters dressed in their best, chatting, drinking and playing the traditional flute. Friendly as they are, the H'Mong and Dao boys do not shy away having a drink with a foreigner and sharing a piece of (maize cake). Sapa is already a popular tourist destination in the Tay Bac region. Here also, the visitor can get glimpses of the ethnic minority way of life. These communities cultivate, maize, rice and other grains and vegetables on terraced fields that are major attraction. The age-old practice of the market being the rendez-vous for young people to court still continues, though there have been concerns about it being disturbed by domestic and foreign tourists. In the Tay Bac region, however, there remains plenty for the visitor to discover and savour"

																Ha Noi is the political capital of Vietnam. Ha Noi lies in Red River Delta and is situated in a tropical area having a strong monsoon influence. The name of Ha Noi (Interior side of a river) has been+derived from an ancient language which is literally known as a land area located in the inner side of Red River. It does not mean that the city is inside the river, but it is embraced by about 100 km of the Red River dykes. Ha Noi has four inner precincts (Hoan Kiem, Ba Dinh, Hai Ba Trung, Dong Da) and five suburban districts (Tu Liem, Thanh Tri, Gia Lam, Dong Anh and Soc Son). From the time when the first State of ancient Vietnam was established, Ha Noi (formerly Thang+Long) has been considered a sacred and typical part of Vietnam. It was in the autumn of 1010 that Ly Cong ?an (also known as Ly Thai To) - the founder of Nha Hau Ly (Post-Ly Dynasty) - removed the court from Hoa Lu (present-day Ninh Binh province) to Dai La Citadel which was later renamed as Thang Long. As soon as the royal fleet with King Ly Thai To aboard cast anchors at the landing wharf in the Nhi River (present-day Red River), there ascended a golden dragon. Thinking that it was a good omen for his trip, King Ly Thai To had Dai La Citadel renamed Thang Long (Ascending Dragon). He also had Hoa Lu - his former capital - renamed Truong Yen. 1397 was the year marking an end to the decline of Nha Hau Le (Post-Le Dynasty). It was the time when the king indulged himself in entertainments. Ho Quy Ly, a high-ranking court+official, overthrew the king and proclaimed himself the king of a new dynasty - Ho Dynasty. This dynasty removed the court to Tay Do (Western Capital) in Thanh Hoa province. Thang Long was then renamed Dong Do (Eastern Capital). In 1407, the Ming aggressors defeated the army of Ho Dynasty. They rushed to Dong Do Citadel and renamed it Dong Quan Citadel. In 1418, a farmer whose name was Le Loi (future Le Thai To) grouped an insurrection army in Lam Son district in Thanh Hoa province. He proclaimed himself as Binh Dinh Vuong (King+of Pacification) and led the resistance against the aggressors for 10 years and regained national independence. He entered the then Dong Quan Citadel and the next year, he renamed the citadel as Dong Kinh (Eastern Imperial City). In 1527, when a new dynasty - Nha Mac (Mac Dynasty) - was in the control of the country, the citadel resumed its former name (Thang Long). In 1802, King Gia Long established the first court of Nha Nguyen (Nguyen Dynasty) in Phu Xuan in the central coastal city of Hue. Thang Long was then used as the regional capital exercising+influence on 11 northern citadels. But the word LONG which literally meant RuNG (Dragon) was changed to 'long' which was understood as 'thinh' (Prosperity). In 1831, King Minh Mang established the province of Ha Noi which includes the ancient Thang Long Citadel and the districts of Tu Liem, ung Hoa, Thuong Tin and Ly Nhan. In 1888, after the tragic defeat of Nha Nguyen (Nguyen Dynasty), Ha Noi became a colonial city until 1954. Ha Noi capital was liberated from French colonialists on October 10, 1954. After April 30, 1975, Ha Noi was+officially recognized as the capital of Vietnam by the communist goverment. In the old days, each of 36 guild streets in Ha Noi had its+name closely associated with the trade and occupation of the inhabitants Now, Ha Noi has 381 streets representing a tenfold increase as compared with the ancient Ha Noi with 36 guild streets only. These are some tourist attractions of Ha Noi"

The town is 120 kilometres from Rach Gia (provincial capital of Kien Giang) and 370 kilometres from Saigon. Ha Tien has 10 famous tourist attractions the names of which are mentioned in a piece of poetry named ""Ha Tien Thap Vinh"". Besides the attraction of swimming in the sea, visitors are likely to be interested in sightseeing. And the most likely place to be is Dong Ho (Dong Lake). The lake is two kilometres wide and about three kilometres long. The vast water surface looks tranquil all the time, due to the shelter offered by the surrounding mountains"
Ha Tien
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									nh is situated 340km from Ha Noi. Dong Loc is the meeting place of the two provincial roads 5 and 15 in the hilly area of Ha Tinh province. During the anti-US war, Dong Loc Forked Road was the main junction of the supply line from the North to Ho Chi Minh Trail. US aircraft concentrated a great number of bombs and ammunitions in repeated efforts to destroy the junction and the surrounding area. This less than 0-km section of road had to undergo 2,057 bombardments. A memorable place is the native village of the great poet Nguyen Du. Nguyen Du was born in 1765 from a family of scholars and illustrious mandarins. Having successfully passed the provincial examinations at the age of nineteen, he served as military mandarin under Le Canh Hung. In 1789, Nguyen Hue (emperor Quang Trung) made a northward advance and drove 290,000 Qing invaders out of the country. King Le Chieu Thong cowardly fled the country and followed the invaders. After the fall of the Le Dynasty, Nguyen Du refused to serve Nguyen Hue. Instead, he chose to live in poverty for 10 years in his wife's native village in Thai Binh province In 1802, Nguyen Du grudgingly accepted service under Gia Long, the founder of Nha Nguyen (Nguyen Dynasty). However, in his heart, he did not like mandarin work and applied for retirement no less than three times, each time in vain. He was named Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Rites. In 1820, he died in the royal capital of Hue. His most famous work is Kieu Story, a narrative in 3,254 verses. With this work, Nguyen Du stands out as the greatest poet Vietnam has ever produced There is a house in commemoration of Nguyen Du in Tien Dien village. About one kilometre from the house is his tomb"

																													oang Hoa Tham (De Tham,1858-1913) - an insurgent leader in the early 20th century - had Truong Van Nghia as true name and ""Grey Tiger"" as pseudonym. His native village was in Tien Lu (Hung Yen). He took part in the anti-French resistance at the age of 16, in the Yen The (Bac Giang) movement, then became a leader in 1892. The French had+to make peace with him twice. The insurrection spread throughout the midlands and the delta of Tonkin, even in Ha Noi. He also commanded the poisoning in Ha Noi Citadel in 1908. After the French had concentrated nearly 2,000 soldiers for an attack on Yen The (1909), the insurgents suffered heavy losses. Hoang Hoa Tham was betrayed and+murdered on February 10th 1913"

																			t was in Thoi Dai Hung Vuong (Hung Vuong Era) that the first State of the Vietnamese people (Van Lang nation of the Lac Viet people) took shape. By the C14 radioactive method, the archaeologists demonstrate that Hung Vuong Era was not legendary (18 Hung kings of the Hong Bang times were only symbolical). The inhabitants grew vegetables and tubers (especially sticky rice), bred chickens,pigs, dogs, buffaloes and oxen. The hunting and fishing activities were secondary. The casting and forging technics appeared in Dong Son Culture (see also Cac Nen Van Hoa ? Viet Nam). The carpentry and the earthenwares were rather prosperous. The usual clothes included embroidered skirts and brassieres The food included banh chung and banh giay (square cakes made of sticky rice), wine, pickled fish, betel-nuts.. The spiritual life consisted of singing, dancing, carving, painting, tattooing. Sun, angels and totems were worshipped. Differentiation between the rich and the poor resulted in social differentiation, and Van Lang nation came into being"

											g Duy Tan (ruler from 1907 to 1916) whose name at birth was Vinh San was considered the mastermind behind the patriotic armed insurrection led by Thai Phien, Tran Cao Van and many other patriots. The insurrection, however, was soon discovered and crushed and all participants were killed. Only King Duy Tan was exiled to the Reunion island in the Indian Ocean. The king was released from jail only to be dragged into a re-invasion scheme of Vietnam after the World War II. He was fired at in a suspicious air-crack in Middle-Africa on Christmas day of 1945 as his ""Absolute Independence policy"" was not in line with the colonial aspirations of General De Gaulle. Unfortunately, the patriotic king was misunderstood by most Vietnamese people due to his unclear relation with General De Gaulle. By the 1960s, Vietnamese and French researchers brought to light the relation between king Duy Tan and General De Gaulle, proving the unchanging patriotic will of the king. In 942, from the jail island Reunion, listening for the first time to the anti-fascism appeal of General De Gaulle broadcast from Britain, king Duy Tan showed a deep respect and admiration for him. He then founded a war-resistant group operating for the ally- France. With a self-made radio, he recorded and transmitted information to the French Liberation Force against the pro-Germany government at VichyWhen Reunion island was liberated by the French Liberation Force, he voluntarily enrolled as a Radio maitre aboard the ship Leopard. In March 1945, France was liberated. By the end of the year, subsequent to the abdication of king Bao Dai in Vietnam, De Gaulle arranged for 100 parachute commandos in Sai Gon to prepare for the setting up of a dynasty headed by king Duy Tan.But Vinh San (king Duy Tan) knew nothing about this secret scheme. He vigorously believed that the French hero De Gaulle would help him bring peace, re-unification, and complete independence to his home country, Vietnam.+Additionally, he was opposed to the plan of ascending the throne . His political viewpoint was sharply contested and led him to become pessimistic. On December 17, 1945, he predicted his death to his friend and immediately wrote a political statement to express his belief in struggling for the unification of the north, centre and the south of Vietnam. As predicted, the event of his death took place eight days later His statement was veiled in secrecy until 1947 when the Combat newspaper copied and ran it. This delay in publicizing the facts surrounding his death and the nature of his true intentions for planning for a unified Vietnam made him misunderstood by the people of Vietnam. In reality, this patriot deserves the respect of all the peopleIn April 1987, thanks to the joint assistance of the governments of Vietnam and France, the king's remains were moved by his relatives to Vietnam and set down next to the royal mausoleums of King Duc Duc (his grandfather) and King Thanh Thai (his father) in the central city of Hue "

																													c Long Quan - son of Kinh Duong Vuong and Long Nu (Long Vuong's daughter) - had an unusual strength. His father entrusted him with governing the Linh Nam region, suppressing the demons and teaching the people to grow water-rice, to cook rice and to cut wood for building houses. Lac Long Quan married 	Tu Co - De Lai's daughter - who would give birth to a 100-egg bag hatching into 100 sons. 50 out of them followed their father to go down in sea, and the remainder followed their mother to go up in the mountains and became the ancestors of the Viet people. The eldest son was nobody other than King Hung. So, the Viet people always consider themselves as "" Dragon's children, Fairy's grandchildren"". Geographically, this legend reflected the process of exploiting mountains and Northern Delta by the Viet people"

																																																											guyen Du (1766-1820) - a great classical poet - had Tien Dien (Nghi Xuan, Ha Tinh) as native land. Nguyen Du was descended from a noble mandarin family (his father and his elder brother had been prime ministers of Nha Hau Le), but he himself had to pass through many hardships in the 18th century full of troubles. Famous for writing talent, he only graduated as junior bachelor. In 1802, as a mandarin of Nha Nguyen, he was hauntingly worried about the current circumstances. His works were both realistic and romantic. He was the author of Truyen Kieu (a very popular poetic masterpiece), Van Chieu Hon, Bac Hanh Tap Luc and Nam Trung Tap Ngam. World Peace Council classifies Nguyen Du among+memorable cultural celebrities in the world"
Nguyen Du
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												Trai (1380-1442) - a great politician, strategist, diplomat, poet - was born in Thang Long, and his paternal village located in Nhi Khe (Thuong Tin - Ha Tay). His mother was the daughter of Tran Nguyen Dan (a high-ranking mandarin of Nha Tran). His father was Nguyen Phi Khanh who had graduated as doctor. At the age of 20, Nguyen Trai also graduated as doctor and served in the Ho dynasty like his father. On the occurence of the Chinese invasion, Nguyen Phi Khanh was captured and marched off to China. Nguyen Trai was kept under surveillance in Dong Quan (Thang Long). Later, he fled in Lam Son to follow Le Loi (future Le Thai To), submitted Binh Ngo Sach (strategies of the people's war against the Ming invasion). After the enemy had been completely expelled, Nguyen Trai did his best to help Le Loi in the national reconstruction. In 1442, because of dishonest mandarins' great harm, Nguyen Trai and all his three related families were exterminated. His famous works were Binh Ngo Dai Cao, Quan Trung Tu Menh Tap, Quoc 																Tm Thi Tap..."

Our country was Dai Viet with Dong Kinh (Ha Noi) as royal capital. The feudal centralism had the despotic trends, especially in the second half of the 15th century The economic, political, military, educational and cultural fields were considerably developed. Dai Viet became the powerful nation in Southeast Asia. Confucianism held a more and more important position, while the literature reached the apogee under the reign of Le Thanh Ton. Dai Viet defeated Cham Pa, occupied its royal city and set up the Quang Nam administrative division. Because of the ruling class' immoderate luxury, Post-Le Dynasty began to decline since the 17th century. Competition for power between warlords and peasant insurrections broke out everywhere. In 1527, Nha Mac (Mac Dynasty) usurped Nha Hau Le Under the pretext of restoring Nha Hau Le, Lords Nguyen and Trinh sought ways for suppressing Nha Mac. Between 1533 and 1788 was the period when Le passed through renaissance and decline"

The Tay Son times were a glorious period of the Vietnamese history. The Tay Son authorities tried to restore the economy and to develop the national culture.

												han Boi Chau (Sao Nam, 1867-1940) - a strong-willed patriotic scholar with Phan Van San as true name - had his native village in Nam Dan ( Nghe An). His father had been an unsuccessful Confucian scholar. Reputed for being an infant prodigy, he graduated as first laureate of interprovincial examination at the age of 33. With an anti-French strong will, he founded Hoi Duy Tan (Association of Reformists). In 1905, he came to Japan to seek reinforcements and promoted the Dong Du (Advance towards the East) movement. Expelled in 1908, he came to China to found Viet Nam Quang Phuc Hoi (Association for Restoration of Vietnam) in 912, and was imprisoned in Kwantung (Quang Dong) between 1913 and 917. After having met Nguyen ai Quoc in 1925, he intended to change his strategies but was kidnapped in Shangai by the French. He was sentenced to hard labour for life, put under surveillance in Hue and died there. His life reflected the ups and downs of the Vietnamese revolution after the Can Vuong movement and before the birth of Indochinese Communist Party (constitutional monarchy - bourgeois democracy  neo-democratic revolution). He wrote many works in Chinese and Vietnamese languages to awaken the patriotism, such as Hai Ngoai Huyet Thu, Nguc Trung Thu, Phan Boi Chau Nien Bieu, Khong Hoc Dang..."

Born in a Confucianist family, he graduated as doctor and served Nha Nguyen (Nguyen Dynasty). In 1883, he was dismissed and came back to his native village. In 1885, when Can Vuong Decree was promulgated by King Ham Nghi, he rose up in arms against the French invaders. This 10-year resistance inflicted heavy losses to the French. Phan Dinh Phung died of a disease in 1895"

																																								y Nhon, provincial capital of Binh Dinh, is 1,065km from Ha Noi on National Highway 1. In the old days, Quy Nhon was called Thi Nai, the name of a beautiful lake inside the city. Bien Quy Nhon (Quy Nhon+Sea) has an annual average temperature of 25.7oC and is suitable for tourism the year round. Hoang Hau Beach is an ideal place for bathing. Quang Trung Museum is dedicated to Nguyen Hue, a national hero of the 18th century. It was built in his native land of Kien My village, Binh Thanh commune, Tay Son district, some 45km from Quy Nhon City. Nguyen Hue is one of three brothers who led the Tay Son Insurrection. In 1788, he led a great force advancing from Phu Xuan (Hue) to the North. It took 35 days and they exacted an overwhelming defeat on the Qing invaders near Thang Long (now Ha Noi), thereby liberating the royal+capital. He crowned himself Emperor Quang Trung the same year. At Quang Trung Museum, visitors will enjoy music and demonstrations of Vo Tay Son (traditional martial arts of Binh Dinh). In particular, they can+see a young woman, a niece of the 9th generation of Emperor Quang Trung, playing 11 battle drums. In addition, Hoi Van village (Cat Trinh commune, Phu Cat district) is well known for its hot spring. It is composed of+various chemical components useful in the treatment of rheumatism, mental disorder, cardio-vascular diseases and skin diseases. Beside the hot spring, there is a sanatorium which offers steam baths with mineral water of 38oC useful for medical treatment and general health improvement.=Built in 1665 in the Do Ban Citadel - second capital of the Kingdom of Cham Pa some 27km from Quy Nhon City - Thap Thap Pagoda is a Buddhist temple, but its decorations are characterized by the Cham decorative art. Duong Long Cham Tower is also called Thap Nga (Tower of Ivory),+consisting of three towers. This group of towers is one of the most beautiful in Central Vietnam. Banh It Tower is also called Thap Bac (Silver Tower). There, tourists can enjoy a panoramic view of this fertile countryside"

																																											ou can (wine drunk out of a jar through pipes) is very popular among the highlanders, especially in Tay Nguyen. But its flavour differs from one area to another. In Son La (some 300 km north-west of Ha Noi), for example, where the Thai ethnic groups are to be found, people drink ruou can in their own special way. It is drunk on several occasions: Tet festival, wedding parties, ground-breaking ceremonies or other festive days. The jar containing the wine is put at a fixed place (in the middle of the house or the yard), so that as many people as possible can drink it. Pipes are put into the jar prior to drinking and a basinful of pure water is placed beside it. A buffalo horn to be used to pour water into the jar is put on a tray nearby. Not everyone is allowed to drink ruou can. And the order of precedence is strictly observed. But there is no racial discrimination: the Kinh ( Viet) may drink with the Thai and Muong. The ingredients of ruou can include wild leaves, cassava roots and rice which are washed and put above an oven for 20 days or so Then all the mixed ingredients are wrapped with large banana leaves and left in a corner of the house for a couple of days. As soon as the process of fermentation is completed, the whole brew is put into a jar. When all the guests are seated, the host pours water from the basin into the jar. At first, he invites the guests to taste the wine from a jar whose wine is more bitter than others. This is meant to remind everyone of the bitterness of life. Then a second jar is brought in which the wine tastes more pungent. In the third jar, the wine is sweetest symbolizing that "" your heart can be happy after so much grief"". Drinking ruou can is accompanied by Mua Xoe (a dance of the Thai ethnic minorities) and drum beating. All this is to help the host and guests forget all their daily worries and enjoy to the utmost the pleasure of tasting ruou can. (VNS)"

																																																																																					hanh Hoa is a large province of Central Vietnam. Thanh Hoa is composed of three categories of mountain, plain and mid-land terrains. Its coastline is 102km in length. Being the dwelling place of the ancient Viets, Thanh Hoa is proud of the glorious Dong Son culture (see also Cac Nen Van Hoa o Viet Nam). Only 16 km from Thanh Hoa City, Sam Son Beach is very good for bathing. Beside sandy beaches, Sam Son also has some scenic spots such as Trong Mai Island, Doc Cuoc Temple and Co Tien Mount. Citadel of the Ho Dynasty (Thanh Nha Ho) was built in 1397. It was not only the location for the central government, but also a quite military project. All the ancient citadels in Vietnam such as the citadels of Hoa Lu and Co Loa were made of earth, the only exception being the Ho Dynasty Citadel, which was wholly built in block granite, depicting the power of creativeness and industriousness of the labouring people more than six centuries ago. The Ho Citadel Dynasty only existed for 10 years (1397-1407), but its vestiges are still surprising because many of its technical questions remain the unknowns "

																												day's Hue is the provincial capital of Thua Thien - Hue.The melancholy beauty of Hue, capital of the last Vietnamese feudal regime, derives from the quiet Song Huong (Perfume River) weaving its course between rolling hills housing the temples and tombs of the Nguyen Kings This feature of Hue has been enhanced by the recent addition of many modern hotels and offices on the banks of the river. On the southern bank of Perfume River, construction has started beside the Huong Giang Hotel for the new, three-star, 138-room Hue Hotel. Hue is one of the three biggest tourist centres of Vietnam. Its attraction lies first of all in the many temples, palaces and mausoleums of Nha Nguyen (Nguyen Dynasty) built between 1805 and 1832. The old citadel measures 11 kilometres in circumference with a 21-metre thick wall and a flagpole standing 54.4 metres high. The Nguyen kings, from Tu Duc and Minh Mang to Dong Khanh and Thieu Tri were buried in mausoleums of different architectural styles. Hue also boasts nearly one hundred Buddhist pagodas and temples. Visitors should not miss Thien Mu Pagoda built in 1601 on a very poetic site on the bank of Perfume River, or the Tu Dam pagoda.=Among Hue's many tourist attractions are Perfume River, Ngu Mountain, Trang Tien and Phu Xuan bridges, Vong Canh (Belvedere) Hill, Bach Ma (White Horse) Mountain, Hai Van Pass, Tam Giang Lagoon, Thuan An and Canh Duong beaches and further north, the Cua Tung and Cua Viet estuaries. Hue also boasts the National College which was attended by patriotic Vietnameses, Duong Mo village with fascinating records from the fight against the French, and the museum devoted to Phan Boi Chau, a prominent patriot during the early years of French domination. From Hue, you can rent a car from the Thua Thien - Hue tourist company to visit the system of tunnels in Vinh Moc village dug during the Vietnam war and Hien Luong bridge at the demarcation line established between North and South Vietnam following the 1954 Geneva Conference. Then you can proceed to Con Tien and Doc Mieu, famous battle sites where vestiges of the US defence line are till visible, and further west, the mysterious Ho Chi Minh Trail. Visitors will never be bored by monotony or repetition during a ten-day or five-day package tour of Hue. If you are an admirer of antiquities, you may order a ""royal feast"" at the Huong Giang Hotel or sit on a ""dragon"" rowboat (which used to cater for the royal family only) and listen to the mellow song of young girls rowing. If you want to watch the quiet glory of dusk over the Huong River you can hire a room at the Huong Giang or Hue hotels. If you like to listen to the lapping of sea waves, go to Tan My Hotel on the beach at Thuan An. If you want a completely still night, you may choose Thuan Hoa or Morin hotels. Wherever you go you will be treated to the most varied traditional dishes of Hue, prepared and served by lovely girls dressed in the violet ""ao dai"" (long gown) which is also a typical feature of Hue.=From Ha Noi or Saigon, you can reach Hue by air, land and water. A twice weekly air service has just been inaugurated between Phu Bai airport in Hue and Tan Son Nhat airport in Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh. A similar service will soon operate between Hue and Ha Noi, and arrangements are being made with Thai Airlines to link Phu Bai with Bangkok. In 1991 the Thua Thien - Hue tourist company received 60,000 guests including 10,000 foreigners. Investment on infrastructure will increase from 4.2 billion dong in 1991 to 10.5 billion this year.With its present capacity, Hue can receive at any one time 1,100 guests at both state-owned hotels which have more than 500 rooms, plus at private mini-hotels and homes To know more about Hue, please search the entry Thua Thien - Hue"

									n Thu Do (1194-1264) was an eminent politician. With Hung Ha (Thai Binh) as native village, Tran Thu Do was born in a dignitary's family. He commanded the corps in defence of Nha Hau Ly (Post-Ly Dynasty)'s royal capital, then made artful arrangements for the abdication of Ly Chieu Hoang in favour of Tran Canh, which would form the Nha Tran (Tran Dynasty). Becoming the royal chancellor, he was a good ruler and achieved many merits in the resistance war against the Mongol invaders in 1258. Tran Thu Do was famous for his saying: "" Whenever my head has not fallen on the ground, I beg Your Majesty not to worry"""

										t ethnic group occupies 87% of the Vietnamese population. From the first residential area in Hong (Red River), Ca and Ma basin, they gradually advanced southwards together with other ethnic groups. The concentration was noticeable in the deltas from lower section of Red River, Coastal Centre to lower section of Mekong River. Viet's residential sphere spread uninterruptedly from the Ngoc cape to Ha Tien where the continental and oceanic ecological environments met each other The society was tightly organized in form of hamlets, villages, communes and townlets. Each village was a factor maintaining the traditional social structure of the Viet ethnic group and where small trade, agricultural and handicraft production took place. Its familiar landscapes resided in rice-fields, gardens, ponds, breeding and handicraft occupations Linguistically, there was the transition from Chinese language to nom language, then to quoc ngu (national language) with Latin-based letters in the late 19th century"
